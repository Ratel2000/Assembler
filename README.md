# Assembler

A Two-Pass Assembler for demo computer

## Overview

This project implements a two-pass assembler for demo computer assembly language. The assembler processes source code files, performs symbol resolution, and generates machine code output. It follows a two-pass approach, where the first pass builds a symbol table, and the second pass generates the machine code.

## Features

- **Two-Pass Processing:** The assembler follows a two-pass algorithm to process source code efficiently.

- **Symbol Table:** Maintains a symbol table for tracking labels, external symbols, and entry points.

- **Output Files:** Generates object files, externals files, and entries files based on the input source code.
